I am 16 and Founder at Auxin. I develop meaningful experiences on the Web, Mobile, and Cloud. I'm also an avid ML/AI Engineer working to solve problems and make the world a better place. 

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy writing stories on Medium, poems, articles, and research papers while also swimming to keep my body in sync. I am interested in fields such as Science and want to know more about them. I'm looking to pursue my undergrad in CS and Philosophy.
